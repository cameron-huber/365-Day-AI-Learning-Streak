# 365 Day AI Learning Streak
Learning how AI models function from the ground up, day by day.

Background:
After completing a 365 day streak for the past 2 years and seeing significant improvements, I want to apply my consistency to something intellectual instead of physical this year.
- 365 days of running at least 1 mile per day (3:19 marathon PR, 3rd place 30k ultra-marathon finish, top 50 on 50 mile ultra-marathon finish)
- 365 days of lifting at least muscle group per day (171 lbs @ 14% body fat -> 193lbs @ 15% body fat, 1000lbs combined: bench press, deadlift, squat)

Goals:
- Go deep on a single challenging subject that has long-term relevance
- Develop a respected opinion on the subject
- Meet smart folks leading research on the subject
- Discover where the gaps are and why
- Be able to make reasoned assumptions on what it takes to fill the gaps

Assumptions underpinning my choice of AI:
- AI isn’t a trend and it will continue to reshape industries for decades
- Most of AI’s bottlenecks happen in infra, not just algorithms
- Respect in a tech comes from beging able to talk with practitioners and researchers, not just knowing theory
- To make credible assumptions about the future, you need to understand the fundamentals

Rules:
1.	No days less than 15 min.
2.	Log learnings daily
3.	Share publicly

Measurement:
- Scored weekly quizzes with ChatGPT
- Monthly synthesis (short essay/thread/diagram)
