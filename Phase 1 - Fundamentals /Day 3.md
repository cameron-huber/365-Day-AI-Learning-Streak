# Wednesday: Linear Transformations

**Learn:** How matrices transform space and data  
**Time:** 40 minutes

## Block 1: Concrete Example First (8 minutes)

**Start with this transformation:** Apply matrix [2 0; 0 3] to point (1,1)
- Calculate by hand: What's the new position?
- Draw before/after on graph paper
- Try 3 more points: (0,1), (1,0), (-1,1)
- **Quick insight:** What pattern do you see?

## Block 2: Build the Theory (12 minutes)

**Resource:** 3Blue1Brown Episode 3 (watch minutes 0:00-6:00 only)

**Active watching:**
- Pause at 2:30 and predict what [1 -1; 1 1] does to unit square
- Pause at 4:15 and work the example yourself first
- **Don't take notes** - focus on connecting to your Block 1 example

## Block 3: Hands-On Practice (15 minutes)

**Problem Set:**

### Problem 1: Matrix [0 -1; 1 0] (rotation)
- Apply to points (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,0)
- Draw the transformation
- What geometric operation is this?

### Problem 2: Matrix [1 2; 0 1] (shear)
- Transform the unit square step-by-step
- Where do corners (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) go?
- Sketch the parallelogram result

### Problem 3: Your choice matrix [a b; c d]
- Pick your own values for a,b,c,d
- Predict what it will do, then calculate
- Test with 2-3 points to verify

## Block 4: Self-Test & AI Connection (5 minutes)

**Test yourself (no looking back):**
1. If I want to double all x-coordinates, what matrix?
2. If I want to flip across y-axis, what matrix?
3. What does [3 0; 0 3] do geometrically?

**AI Connection Check:**
- Explain in 1 sentence: How is an edge-detection filter like a matrix transformation?
- **Answer:** "An edge-detection filter transforms pixel neighborhoods - bright pixels become positive, dark become negative, revealing boundaries just like how our matrices transformed coordinates to reveal geometric relationships."

## Resources
- **Primary:** 3Blue1Brown Episode 3 (partial viewing as noted)
- **Backup:** Khan Academy "Introduction to Linear Transformations"
- **Tools needed:** Graph paper or digital graphing tool

## Success Criteria
Can manually apply any 2x2 matrix to transform points, predict geometric effects before calculating, and explain how this connects to AI feature detection without looking at notes.
