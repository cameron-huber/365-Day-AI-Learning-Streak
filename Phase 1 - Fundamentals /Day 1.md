## ‚è∞ Time Block Breakdown

### Block 1: Foundation (12 minutes)
**Watch & Interact** (0:00-4:00 of video)
- **Pause at 2:00** ‚Üí Draw what you think a vector looks like before Grant explains it
- **Pause at 4:00** ‚Üí Write down: "A vector is ___" in your own words
- **Active note-taking:** Use two columns - "Arrow View" vs "Number List View"

### Block 2: Operations Deep Dive (15 minutes)
**Watch & Practice** (4:00-9:57 of video)
- **As you watch:** Sketch each operation Grant shows
- **Pause after vector addition** ‚Üí Try adding [3,1] + [1,2] on paper
- **Pause after scaling** ‚Üí Calculate 2 √ó [3,1] and -0.5 √ó [4,2]

### Block 3: Practice Activities (12 minutes)
**Exercise 1: Vector Arithmetic** (6 minutes)
- Calculate: [5,2] + [-1,4] = ?
- Calculate: 3 √ó [2,-1] = ?
- Draw both on a coordinate plane

**Exercise 2: Real Vectors** (6 minutes)
- Your height and weight as a vector: [your_height_cm, your_weight_kg]
- A friend's data: [friend_height_cm, friend_weight_kg]  
- What would the "average" vector represent?

### Block 4: Check Understanding & Connect (6 minutes)
**Self-Test Questions:**
1. How is [3,4] different from just saying "3 and 4"?
2. If I scale vector [2,1] by -1, what happens to its direction?
3. Why might representing words as vectors be useful for AI?

**Tomorrow Preview:** 
"Tomorrow we'll explore vector spaces - the 'playgrounds' where vectors live. Think: if vectors are like arrows, what are the rules of the space they exist in?"

## ü§ñ Real-World AI Connection
**Word Embeddings Example:**
Word embeddings in GPT models represent each word as a high-dimensional vector (typically 512-4096 dimensions). When the model processes 'king' - 'man' + 'woman', it's literally doing vector arithmetic to find 'queen'. The semantic relationships between words become geometric relationships between vectors.

**Try This:** Imagine "happy" = [0.8, 0.2, 0.9] and "sad" = [-0.7, 0.1, -0.8]. What might the middle point represent?

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
By the end of this session, you can:
- [ ] Explain what a vector represents both geometrically (arrow) and numerically (list)
- [ ] Perform basic vector addition and scaling
- [ ] Give one example of why vectors matter for AI/data representation
- [ ] Feel confident moving to vector spaces tomorrow
