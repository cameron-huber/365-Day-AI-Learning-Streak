# Enhancement Request
Please improve my study plan by adding:

Examples before theory - Start with concrete examples, then explain the concept
Clear time blocks - Break the session into 3-4 focused chunks
Active problem-solving - Replace "watch and take notes" with hands-on exercises
Immediate practice - Add 2-3 problems I can work through step-by-step
Self-testing - Include questions to check if I really understand

Keep the same time limit but make it focus on doing rather than just consuming content.
